Data project analyzing correlations between NYC high school data and SAT scores

The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is a test high school students take during the college admission process and used by colleges in their admission decisions. High schools are often ranked by how well their students perform on the SAT. Some debate that the test is unfair to certain students. Therefore, since New York City has a diverse population, data from New York City high schools and their students' SAT scores was used to detemine the fairness of the SAT from different demographic angles.
